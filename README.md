## Data Flow

In the E-commerce API application, data flows through various components to handle operations related to different entities, including users, products, orders, and addresses. Here's an overview of the data flow for each entity:

1. **User Entity**

    - **Controller Layer**

      The Controller layer handles user-related HTTP requests and routes them to the appropriate service methods.

      ```java
      // UserController.java
 
      @RestController
      @RequestMapping("/users")
      public class UserController {
          // Define user-related endpoints and methods
      }
      ```

    - **Service Layer**

      The Service layer contains business logic and interacts with the UserRepository to perform CRUD operations on user data.

      ```java
      // UserService.java
 
      @Service
      public interface UserService {
          // Implement user-related service methods
      }
      ```

    - **Repository Layer**

      The Repository layer manages data access to the user entity using Spring Data JPA.

      ```java
      // UserRepository.java
 
      @Repository
      public interface UserRepository extends JpaRepository<User, UUID> {
          // Define custom queries or repository methods if needed
      }
      ```

    - **User Entity**

      The User Entity represents the structure of user data in the database.

      ```java
      // User.java (User Entity)
 
      @Entity
      public class User {
          // Define user attributes, getters, setters, etc.
      }
      ```

2. **Product Entity**

    - **Controller Layer**

      The Controller layer handles product-related HTTP requests and routes them to the appropriate service methods.

      ```java
      // ProductController.java
 
      @RestController
      @RequestMapping("/products")
      public class ProductController {
          // Define product-related endpoints and methods
      }
      ```

    - **Service Layer**

      The Service layer contains business logic and interacts with the ProductRepository to perform CRUD operations on product data.

      ```java
      // ProductService.java
 
      @Service
      public interface ProductService {
          // Implement product-related service methods
      }
      ```

    - **Repository Layer**

      The Repository layer manages data access to the product entity using Spring Data JPA.

      ```java
      // ProductRepository.java
 
      @Repository
      public interface ProductRepository extends JpaRepository<Product, UUID> {
          // Define custom queries or repository methods if needed
      }
      ```

    - **Product Entity**

      The Product Entity represents the structure of product data in the database.

      ```java
      // Product.java (Product Entity)
 
      @Entity
      public class Product {
          // Define product attributes, getters, setters, etc.
      }
      ```

3. **Order Entity**

    - **Controller Layer**

      The Controller layer handles order-related HTTP requests and routes them to the appropriate service methods.

      ```java
      // OrderController.java
 
      @RestController
      @RequestMapping("/orders")
      public class OrderController {
          // Define order-related endpoints and methods
      }
      ```

    - **Service Layer**

      The Service layer contains business logic and interacts with the OrderRepository to perform CRUD operations on order data.

      ```java
      // OrderService.java
 
      @Service
      public interface OrderService {
          // Implement order-related service methods
      }
      ```

    - **Repository Layer**

      The Repository layer manages data access to the order entity using Spring Data JPA.

      ```java
      // OrderRepository.java
 
      @Repository
      public interface OrderRepository extends JpaRepository<Order, UUID> {
          // Define custom queries or repository methods if needed
      }
      ```

    - **Order Entity**

      The Order Entity represents the structure of order data in the database.

      ```java
      // Order.java (Order Entity)
 
      @Entity
      public class Order {
          // Define order attributes, getters, setters, etc.
      }
      ```

      The Controller layer handles address-related HTTP requests and routes them to the appropriate service methods.

      ```java
      // AddressController.java
 
      @RestController
      @RequestMapping("/addresses")
      public class AddressController {
          // Define address-related endpoints and methods
      }
      ```

    - **Service Layer**

      The Service layer contains business logic and interacts with the AddressRepository to perform CRUD operations on address data.

      ```java
      // AddressService.java
 
      @Service
      public interface AddressService {
          // Implement address-related service methods
      }
      ```

    - **Repository Layer**

      The Repository layer manages data access to the address entity using Spring Data JPA.

      ```java
      // AddressRepository.java
 
      @Repository
      public interface AddressRepository extends JpaRepository<Address, UUID> {
          // Define custom queries or repository methods if needed
      }
      ```

    - **Address Entity**

      The Address Entity represents the structure of address data in the database.

      ```java
      // Address.java (Address Entity)
 
      @Entity
      public class Address {
          // Define address attributes, getters, setters, etc.
      }
      ```

You can create these tables in your database using SQL or an ORM tool like Hibernate based on the provided structure. Adjust the data types and constraints as per your database system's requirements.



## Data Structures Used

The project utilizes the following data structures:

#### User Class

The `User` class defines the structure for user data and includes fields such as `userId`, `username`, `email`, `password`, and timestamps.

#### Product Class

The `Product` class defines the structure for product data and includes fields such as `productId`, `productName`, `price`, `quantity`, `description`, and timestamps.

#### Order Class

The `Order` class defines the structure for order data and includes fields such as `orderId`, `orderStatus`, `totalAmount`, and timestamps.

#### ArrayList Usage

ArrayLists can be used to represent lists of items in your application. For example, you can use an ArrayList to represent a list of order items in an order.
